# 3bus_LMPs
An illustration of how transmission congestion creates negative LMPs, and thus a benefit to increasing load. Note there are no renewables or start up/shut down costs here, the negative prices are purely due to snapshot-OPF congestion. There are also no upper limits on the maximum output of each generators.

Left: $7600

Right (Increased load at bus 1 by 70 MWh): $3400
